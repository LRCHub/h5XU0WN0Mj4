I'm in my moon phase
My pink days
When everything is okay
I am beautiful, invincible
Perfectly impossible
And nothing in this world can
shake me
Trip me up or complicate me
Love is all that motivates me
I'm on a supernatural high
Got a supernatural life
You're the reason I'm on a
supernatural high
I'm on a cool trip
A skinny dip
Swimmin' in the thick of it
I'm a free bird, the magic word
The sweetest sound you've ever
heard
And nothing in this world can
change me
Turn me out or rearrange me
Love is all that matters lately
(Chorus)
Dancin' without touching ground
I'm flyin' on the wings of how I
feel when you're around
I'm in my moon phase
My pink days
When everything is okay
I got a sure thing, the gold
ring
I'm waking up my wildest dreams
And nothing in this world can
change me
Turn me out or rearrange me
Love is all that motivates me
I'm on a supernatural high
Got a supernatural life
You're the reason I'm on a
supernatural high
